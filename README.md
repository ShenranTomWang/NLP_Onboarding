Welcome to the UBC NLP Group! We are glad to have a new talent joining us. This is a tutorial that will help you quickly onboard to the group and obtain access to compute.

## Get in Contact
Our group uses [Slack](https://slack.com/) for communications. Please download Slack and ask your supervisor or other students to add you to the group.

## Compute Access
There are three sources of compute available for all members: [Compute Canada](compute/Compute_Canada.md), UBC's [ARC Sockeye](compute/ARC_Sockeye.md) and the [NLP Group Compute Servers](compute/NLP_Servers.md). Depending on your supervisor, you may have other compute resources available to you. Detailed instructions to get access for these resources as well as a simple tutorial are provided in the above links. The goal of this documentation is for you to obtain access to these compute resources and learn basic usage of these resources. For more technical documentations, you may wish to consult the technical documentation of each cluster instead.

## Supervisor-specific Onboarding Instructions
Depending on your supervisor, there may be different onboarding instructions. These instructions are under [supervisor](supervisor/).
