## Get in Contact
Our group uses [Slack](https://slack.com/) for communications. Please download Slack and ask your supervisor or other students to add you to the group.

## Compute Access
There are three sources of compute available for all members: [Compute Canada](compute/Compute_Canada.md), UBC's [ARC Sockeye](compute/ARC_Sockeye.md) and the [NLP Group Compute Servers](compute/NLP_Servers.md). Depending on your supervisor, you may have other compute resources available to you. Detailed instructions to get access for these resources as well as a simple tutorial are provided in the above links.

## Supervisor-specific Onboarding Instructions
Depending on your supervisor, there may be different onboarding instructions. These instructions are under [supervisor](supervisor/).
